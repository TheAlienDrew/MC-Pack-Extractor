# MC-Pack-Extractor
No matter what system you have, a script has been made to extract the resource or texture pack from the Minecraft version of your choosing.
Do note that this script only works on the official versions that the [Minecraft Launcher](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_launcher) downloads.

COMPATIBILITY: Windows, Mac, & Linux!

* Features still left to implement:
  - Windows version doesn't have a system based zip/unzip backup for when someone can't use 7-Zip
  - Sounds aren't currently bundled with the resource packs, but is planned. > For now just use [this](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Sound_directory)
  - Currently only supports Minecraft: Java Edition, but support is planned for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (Windows 10 and Android Only so far it seems)
