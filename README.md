# MC-Pack-Extractor
No matter what system you have, a script has been made to extract the resource or texture pack from the Minecraft version of your choosing.

COMPATIBILITY: Windows, Mac, & Linux!

* Features still left to implement:
  - Windows version doesn't have a system based zip/unzip backup for when someone can't use 7-Zip
  - Sounds aren't currently bundled with the resource packs, but is planned. > For now just use https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Sound_directory
  - Currently only supports Minecraft: Java Edition, but support is planned for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (Windows 10 and Android Only so far it seems)
